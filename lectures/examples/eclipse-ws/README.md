# How to import this folder into Eclipse

* Clon this repo to your local computer, or just download it using this link: 
  
    https://github.com/bjornregnell/lth-eda016-2015/archive/master.zip

* Start eclipse and browse to this folder called eclipse-ws and select it as workspace

* In Eclipse select the menu item: File -> New -> Java Project

* Write as Project Name "lecture-examples" and click the "Finish"-button

* Now you should have a src folder with all the examples. 

* If you do git pull from the repo as it is updated, you need to do File -> Refresh (or press F5).
