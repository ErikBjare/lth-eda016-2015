# How to build course plan of EDA016 #

The file `body.md` includes markdown text of the body of the coursplan.

Run this in a Linux terminal:

```bash
source build.sh
```

This will create a [pdf](https://github.com/bjornregnell/lth-eda016-2015/blob/master/courseplan/courseplan.pdf) with the course plan.
